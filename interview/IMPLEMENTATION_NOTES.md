# Implementation Notes

## Overview

This is a full-stack CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system built using Django REST Framework for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

## Key Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

**Framework & Database:**
- Django 4.2 with Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for Celery message broker

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`
- Custom User model with role-based permissions (Manager/Agent)
- Manager: Full CRUD access
- Agent: Cannot delete leads or contacts

**Core Models:**
- `Lead`: Main CRM entity tracking potential customers
- `Contact`: Multiple contacts per lead
- `Note`: Text notes attached to leads
- `Reminder`: Scheduled reminders with Celery integration
- `Correspondence`: Log of communications (email, phone, meeting)
- `AuditLog`: Automatic tracking of all changes

**API Features:**
- RESTful API with ViewSets
- Filtering using django-filter
- Search across multiple fields
- Ordering/sorting support
- Pagination (20 items per page)
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

**Background Tasks:**
- Celery for asynchronous task processing
- Celery Beat for scheduled tasks
- Email reminders (placeholder implementation)

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework:**
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Vuex for state management
- Vue Router for navigation
- Axios for HTTP requests

**Key Features:**
- Dashboard with real-time statistics
- Lead management with full CRUD
- Contact management
- Notes and reminders
- Correspondence tracking
- CSV export functionality
- Role-based UI elements

**State Management:**
- Separate Vuex modules for auth, leads, contacts, reminders
- LocalStorage for JWT token persistence
- Automatic token injection via Axios interceptors

### Design Decisions

**Why These Technologies:**
- Django REST Framework: Robust, well-documented, rapid development
- Vue.js 3: Lightweight, reactive, excellent documentation
- PostgreSQL: Reliable, supports complex queries, good for production
- Celery: Industry standard for Python background tasks
- Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments

**Code Organization:**
- Backend follows Django app structure (models, views, serializers, urls)
- Frontend follows Vue best practices (components, views, store modules)
- Separation of concerns throughout
- Comprehensive error handling

**Security Measures:**
- JWT tokens with short expiration (1 hour)
- Password hashing with Django's default PBKDF2
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Permission classes for API endpoints

### Database Schema

**Lead Model:**
- Tracks customer information, status, priority, estimated value
- One-to-many relationship with Contacts
- Owned by a User (agent/manager)

**Contact Model:**
- Linked to Lead
- Can be marked as primary contact
- One-to-many relationship with Correspondence

**AuditLog:**
- Automatically created on model changes
- Stores JSON representation of changes
- Tracks user, timestamp, IP address

### API Endpoints

All endpoints follow REST conventions:

```
/api/leads/                 - List and create leads
/api/leads/{id}/            - Retrieve, update, delete lead
/api/leads/export_csv/      - Export leads to CSV
/api/contacts/              - Contact management
/api/notes/                 - Note management
/api/reminders/             - Reminder management
/api/correspondences/       - Correspondence tracking
/api/auditlogs/             - Audit trail (Manager only)
/api/dashboard-stats/       - Dashboard statistics
/api/auth/login/            - User authentication
/api/auth/register/         - User registration
/api/auth/me/               - Current user profile
```

### Sample Data

The system includes Kenyan-based sample data:
- 2 users (manager, agent)
- 10 sample leads with Kenyan names and companies
- Contacts for each lead
- Sample notes, reminders, and correspondence
- Automatically created on first startup

### Testing

Manual testing performed:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Lead CRUD operations
- Contact management
- Notes and reminders
- Correspondence logging
- Dashboard statistics
- CSV export
- Permission enforcement

### Known Limitations

- Email sending is a placeholder (prints to console)
- No file upload for attachments
- Basic UI styling (functional over flashy)
- No real-time notifications (would require WebSockets)

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Real email integration (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- File attachments for correspondence
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Email templates
- Calendar integration for reminders
- Mobile responsive improvements
- Unit and integration tests

### Performance Considerations

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Select_related and prefetch_related for reducing queries
- Pagination to handle large datasets
- Redis caching could be added for frequently accessed data
