    # Actually, for a pure "free" tier attempt, we might want to run Redis as a private service (Docker) instead of a managed instance if cost is a concern, 
    # but managed is standard. Let's stick to managed for "production ready" and user can downgrade if needed.
    # Correction: Render doesn't have a free Redis tier. 
    # Let's use a private service for Redis to keep it "deployable" without immediate cost if possible, or just define it and let the user know.
    # For simplicity and standard practice, I'll define it as a managed instance but comment about cost.
